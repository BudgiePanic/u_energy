## How To Run The Project

1. Acquire a copy of the project
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code
3. Run the command ```npm i``` to **install** the project dependencies 
4. Run the command ```npm run dev``` to start the web server
5. Use the left hand side navigation menu to visit different pages on the website 

- Make sure you have ```npm``` installed on your computer. ```npm``` is acquired by installing ```node js``` on your computer. The university computers should already have it installed. 
- Make sure you have opened visual studio code in the correct folder. You can check which folder you are in by running the command ```pwd```. You should be inside the ```.../swen422-assignment3/energy-visualisation``` folder when running ```npm``` commands.
